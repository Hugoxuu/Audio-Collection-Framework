# This helper variable will contain the python interpreter XY version number,
# e.g CPython27 -> 27
#version=${1##$type}

# By default, this script will build for every version of Python enabled in your
# versionset.

# Uncomment any desired lines below, or add your own logic to filter any
# interpreters you don't want to build for.

# Filter a specific interpreter type:
# [[ $type == CPython ]] && exit 1
# [[ $type == Jython ]] && exit 1
# [[ $type == PyPy ]] && exit 1

# Filter everything except a specific interpreter type:
# [[ $type == CPython ]] || exit 1
# [[ $type == Jython ]] || exit 1
# [[ $type == PyPy ]] || exit 1

# Version requirements, test by string:
# [[ $version == 2* ]] || exit 1  # 2 only

# Comment out this line to allow your package to build for Python3
# Read this first: https://pythonclock.org/
#[[ $version == 3* ]] || exit 1  # 3 only

[[ $1 == CPython34 ]] || exit 1   # only build for CPython 2.7
